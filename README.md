# Elevating-ACME
A comprehensive data analysis report for ACME, uncovering key customer insights, sales volume trends, and pricing dynamics and provided actionable suggestions to enhance management decision-making.
I have Utilized SQL, Microsoft Access, Databases, and Excel to generate an excel report and then a formal report. Further Forecasting techniques have been applied to predict both Best and worst products, invaluable insights into company sales, finances, and payment methods to elevate the company. 

# Major Steps

- Forcasting and linear regression techniques were used to predict the various topics
- Suggestion and strategic plans were made for the management for better functioning and overall profits. 

# Won the title of TOP 5 projects and Data Analysis with Databases Badge
The project was considered as the one of the top 5 projects among the class of 100-150 students and was added to Hall Of Fame( Dr. Lawrence's Website)
Also,got the badge, presented by UBC Faculty under the guidance of Dr. Ramon Lawrence, which is awarded to a student with one of the top data analysis projects (minimum 90% score) in COSC 304 Introduction to Databases in a given year. The data analysis project involves analyzing a large data set to determine trends, perform predictions, and construct visualizations and reports. Software systems used include relational databases (MySQL, SQL Server) and analytics software (Excel, Tableau).
